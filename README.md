# Cryptocurrencies
Module 18 of Data Analytics Bootcamp

# Overview

### Checkpoint 1
Preprocessed a cryptocurrency dataset in order to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Checkpoint 2
Using PCA algorithm, I reduced the dimensions of the X DataFrame to three principal components and placed these dimensions in a new DataFrame.

### Checkpoint 3
I created an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the pcs_df DataFrame created in Checkpoint 2. Then, I ran the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data.

### Checkpoint 4
I visualized the distinct groups that corresponded to the three principal components I created in Checkpoint 3, then I created a table with all the currently tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function.
